# Module 17 Challenge Data Analytics

## Overview:
Develop 6 different machine learning models to perform a loan prediction risk analysis to share with Martha for XXXX.

## Resources: 

## Results: 

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.
There is a bulleted list that describes the balanced accuracy score and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models (15 pt)

### Deliverable 1: Use Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk 

#### Random Oversampling Algorithm


#### SMOTE Oversampling ALgorithm


#### ClusterCentroids Algorithm



### Deliverable 2: Use the SMOTEENN alogrithm to Predict Credit Risk

#### Combination Oversampling and Undersampling SMOTEENN



### Deliverable 3 Use Ensemble Classifiers to Predict Credit Risk

#### Balanced Random Forest Classifier



#### Easy Ensemble Classifier




## Summary:

There is a recommendation on which model to use, or there is no recommendation with a justification (3 pt)
